# AP-CCNter

A service about the entrance of AP-CCN members when there is a conference.


## QR code for your conference

After you finished registration of any conference at AP-CCN, you would get a QR code (on a special electrical namecard) for each conference you just signed up for. 


### What to do with the QR code?

Tap the QR code onto the sensor and then you will get:

1. Your check-in done.

2. The documents you may need according to your membership in AP-CCN.

3. The ballot the match your membership if there is any election. 


### Usage

Just tap your QR code on your device and all things above can be done.


## Warning

Each member can only use a QR code ONCE, and each QR code is only allowed for ONLY ONE member to use.
